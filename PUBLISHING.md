# Publishing to Packagist

This guide explains how to publish the SeAT Member Rewards Programme to Packagist so it's discoverable via Composer.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (already have repo)
- Packagist account (free)
- Git with tags/releases capability
- **SeAT 5.x** (Laravel 10) installation for compatibility
- **PHP 8.1+**

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Release

Create a semantic version tag for your first release:

```bash
# Create and push a git tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Or create via GitHub UI:
1. Go to: https://github.com/rational-chaos-inc/seat-mrp/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `Initial Release`
5. Description: Copy from README.md features
6. Click "Publish release"

## Step 2: Register on Packagist

1. Visit: https://packagist.org
2. Click "Sign up" or "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Authorize GitHub access
4. After login, click "Submit a Package"
5. Enter repository URL: `https://github.com/rational-chaos-inc/seat-mrp.git`
6. Click "Check"
7. Click "Submit"

## Step 3: Enable Auto-Update (GitHub Hook)

To automatically update Packagist when you push tags:

1. Go to: https://packagist.org/packages/rci/member-rewards
2. Click "Settings" (top right)
3. Under "Update Strategy", enable "GitHub Service Hook"
4. Or manually visit: https://packagist.org/api/update-package?username=YOUR_USERNAME&name=rci/member-rewards

## Verification

After publishing, anyone can install via:

```bash
composer require rci/member-rewards
```

## Version Management

For future updates:

```bash
# For minor feature updates
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0

# For bug fixes
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1

# For major breaking changes
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin v2.0.0
```

Packagist will automatically detect new tags and update the package listing.

## Semantic Versioning

Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes

Example progression:
- v1.0.0 - Initial release
- v1.1.0 - Added alerts feature
- v1.1.1 - Fixed dashboard bug
- v2.0.0 - Removed deprecated API endpoints
